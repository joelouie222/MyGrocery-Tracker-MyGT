MyGrocery Tracker (MyGT) 

Have you ever thought of keeping track of your grocery purchases? Have you ever wondered if an item you bought increased in price or another store is selling the same item in a cheaper price? Then, MyGrocery Tracker is the website for you! 


What is MyGrocery Tracker? 

MyGrocery Tracker (MyGT) is a web application that will help the user track their grocery purchases.  The user can enter information about the purchases they have made on a specific date on the website and MyGT will keep track of those purchases for the user by saving the data in a database. (If at all possible, MyGT may also allow so the user to upload an image of the user’s receipt to eliminate the need to save the physical receipt.) MyGT can serve the user as a sorce to look back on their past purchases (or if they needed a copy of a receipt on a specific date.) 

 
Analytic Reports 

Using the information in the database provided by the user, MyGT will be able to display a report the user on items that the user has bought multiple times, an increase/decrease of price on a specific grocery product in a set date (monthly, quarterly, etc.), an indicator when an item is priced lower on a specific grocery store. 


Making a shopping list 

With substantial data provided by the user, the user can make a shopping list for an upcoming trip to the grocery store. The user can select from a list of items they have bought in the past, and add them on the shopping list. The user then have the ability to print this shopping list to help them remember what to buy during their trip to the grocery store. 

 
Rating system/leaving notes 

Another functionality of MyGT will be a rating system or a comment/note about a specific product they have purchased. This could be a positive or negative note about the product. Perhaps they’ve liked the product and they want to leave a note on how the product taste or the quality. So, on the future, when they are making a shopping list, they would have the ability to make better decision or avoid making a mistake of repurchasing a product they did not like in the past.
